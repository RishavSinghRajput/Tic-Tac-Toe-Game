# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A classic 3×3 grid game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Two players alternate placing “X” and “O” in empty cells, with the goal of lining up three marks in a row, column, or diagonal. The game detects wins and draws, displays an end‑game message, and offers a reset or restart button to play again dynamically.
